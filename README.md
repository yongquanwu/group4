This repo contains Group 4's PC2 NUS Money website/app and PC3 Smart Contracts projects.  Code for PC3 comprises back end created using solidity SimpleToken.sol that was deployed to create the Token of Generosity (TOG) token and front end pc3Index.html which is the PC2 testIndex.html modified with an additional 'Get Token Balance' button that upon being clicked calls the getTokenBalance() function in pc3.js which is the PC2 holdingsTable.js modified with the additional getTokenBalance() function to read the number of TOG tokens in metamaask and display it on the NUS Money webpage.  Where code has been added for PC3, both the original PC2 and the modified PC3 files are kept in this repo.  Where code did not need to be modified (e.g. CSS), a single common file is kept that is used for both PC2 and PC3.
